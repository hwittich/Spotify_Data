```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

So I have been using spotify since 2014. That means I have 8 years of listening data to look into.

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
streaming_data <- fread("../data/full_streaming_history.csv")
```

# Streams Per Day
I want to create a histogram of how many songs I streamed every day. First step is to filter out songs that I didn't listen to in full. 
```{r}
not_skipped_songs <- streaming_data %>% filter(reason_end=="trackdone")
```
Then, for each day, I want to generate a count of how many songs I listened to. 
```{r}
#timestamp is stored in POSIXct format
#extract day from POSIXct class with format() function
not_skipped_songs <- not_skipped_songs %>% mutate(date = format(ts, "%Y-%m-%d"))
streamsPerDay <- as.data.frame(table(not_skipped_songs$date), stringsAsFactors=F)


```
